Harget
==========


Just playing around with python so I can mess with the it on the raspberry pi


## Goal

The main goal of using this is to create a server backend to control a very simple screen controller that could be used to push urls to an external monitor which are located on a raspberry pi.

## Installation
Just run the following command on your raspberry pi to install everything

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbam505/harget/master/setup/install.sh)
```
